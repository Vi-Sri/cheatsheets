# Complex numbers

## imaginary number

- $x^2 = -1$ it is **impossible to square a real number and get a negative number**
- However, a solution does exist in a new number system called the **complex number system**

### imaginary unit

- $i = sqrt(-1)$ is an imaginary unit

| 1       | i       | -1      | -i      |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| $i^0$   | $i^1$   | $i^2$   | $i^3$   |
| $i^4$   | $i^5$   | $i^6$   | $i^7$   |
| $vdots$ | $vdots$ | $vdots$ | $vdots$ |

- The pattern $1, i, -1, -i$ repeats

> The previously unsolvable equation is now solvable with the addition of the imaginary unit

## Pure imaginary numbers

- A complex number that has no real part
- By taking multiples of $i$, we can create infinitely many more pure imaginary numbers.

### Example

- $3i$ is a square root of $-9 = 9 (-1)$ is purely imaginary
