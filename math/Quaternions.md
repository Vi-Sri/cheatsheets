# Quaternions

## Intro

- Discovered by **William Rowan Hamilton** (oct 1843)
- **4 Dimensional** number systems **1 real part and 3 imaginary** parts i,j,k.

### Use Cases

- **Computer Graphics, Robotics** and (anything with 3D orientation) uses it because of its elegant way to describe **3D rotation** for its computational efficiency and has no numerical errors that other systems posses.
- **Quantum mechanics**, the special actions quaternions describe in 4D are quite relevant to 2 states systems such as spin of a electron or polarization of proton.
